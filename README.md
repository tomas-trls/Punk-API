# 🎸 PUNK API 🍻

This project is a challenge for the \_Nology training that I am currently undergoing. The PUNK API is a web application that fetches beers with their names, descriptions, images, tagline, and other details from the <a href="https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2">Punk API</a>. The app features a main page with a sidebar that includes a search bar, three sliders, and three checkboxes, and the cards of each beer.It also has details page when a card is click that will inform the user with more information about each beer.

## ⚙️ Features

- Search for beers by name using the search bar
- Filter beers by alcohol by volume using the first slider
- Filter beers by the year they were brewed using the second slider
- Filter beers by pH level using the third slider
- Filter beers by specific alcohol by volume, brewed year, or pH level using the checkboxes
- Fully responsive design

## 🔮 Testing

The Punk API app was developed using React and was thoroughly tested using the React Testing Library. The following components were tested:

- Sidebar
- Sliders
- Cards
- Searchbar

The tests focused on ensuring that the app's components were rendering correctly and that the data from the API was being fetched and displayed accurately. All tests passed successfully, and the app is considered stable and reliable.
